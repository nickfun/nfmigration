* Database Migration 
There are some existing DB Migration tools, but I need something that can handle connection
to multiple databases. Also, the details on how to connect, and how many connections will be 
made, will be in another database.

* Goals
I've used the Laravel migration system a little, my hope is to recreate the major features
of that system.

- CLI interface
- generate migration classes with `up` and `down` methods
- list of databases with credentails stored outside of code
- databases can depend on other databases to supply the details
  - ex: run migrations on a SYSTEM database. the SYSTEM database has a DB table with a list
    of databases that we also need to connect to and run more migrations on
- allow going up and down to any migration point
